in py everthing is object

in py we never assign data types in variable, in reverse reference keeps data types

suppose,
a = 4
a="akash" // here, var a has not assign any data types. line6, a=4 and next line change but py takes time for garbage collection
becuase it thinks if there any king assing in future it can use again same referance


//whatever changes you want to make use parentheses for real production level.

//x = 40+2.23
print(int(x)) //data types much clear for industry level
